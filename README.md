# Overview

This project is my two weeks of looking into how to work with sql databases. I used sqlite3, a python module, to make and use a local databse from my machine. This taught me the basics of SQL and how a programming language, such as python, could be used to work with databases.

This program is not the most sleek or perfect, but I had a lot of fun making it and learned so much. It works along side a game that I like to play called Team Fight Tactics by Riot Games. I made a database that holds the champions, which can be updated changed through python and the terminal, where you can see all the champions and their stats. It also gives suggestions based on champions from your current run on which champions you should pick up next. 

I wrote this software because I wanted a fun way to learn how to work with SQL databases. I figured what better way to learn than to apply it to something you like doing.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

I am using a local database that is saved as a local file through sqlite3.

The program builds two tables, a table with all the info about the Champions themselves and a table for the Origin and Class of each champion.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my programming IDE, python 3.10, the sqlite3 module for python, and Google when I needed to figure something out.

# Future Work

* Update the Suggestion function to take the stats of the individual champions into account.
* Update the user interface to be simpler and more appealing.
* Clean the code to make it more sleek and well designed.
